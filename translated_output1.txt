 I'll call you when I'm not available. Have a nice day. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The number you have dialed is unavailable. I'm sorry. I'm out of money, so I can't take it. I'm sorry. This... I think you dropped it earlier. This isn't mine. Oh... I'll leave it here. I picked it up here. I've been waiting for a long time. Is something wrong? What's wrong? I don't know. I was just waiting for you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's wrong? Oh, right. Happy birthday. It's not 12 o'clock yet. I was going to congratulate you tomorrow. I have a favor to ask you. What is it? If you don't like it, you can refuse it. I'm sorry. I don't know if this is right. I'm not trying to put pressure on you. If I'm with someone, I hope it's you. I hope it's you. I hope it's you. I just thought it would be you. I have a question. Yes. Do you like me? Yes. I don't. Oh, right. I don't have that. This? This? This? Seunggi. Me too. What? Nothing. Aren't you hungry? Do you want to eat something? Yes. Oh, but it's time to turn off the car. Then... Wait here for a second. Okay. I'm sorry. What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? I always thought I was cursed. A child who killed her parents. I wanted to change. But nothing changed. I was cursed. Everyone who was with me would die. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please help me. Please help me. Please help me. You really didn't know about the Sun Ice Line? If I knew, I would've told you. Darn it. I... I got a card every time it was my birthday. I didn't have anyone to send it to. At first, I thought it was my mom. But then I realized. Someone is waiting for my birthday. The day I have to do something will come. And... I think that day is today. I think that day is today. I called you to school. You gave me these glasses. And Sun Ah... I'm sorry. You're saying they're all the same, aren't you? Is there someone at school at this hour? I asked your teacher to send you to school. But he's not coming. He said Lee Gyu Jin is missing. For now, you should go to school and find him. Detective! Over there! Hey, sunglasses! I almost died. What happened? Who did this? You told me to come to school. But I don't remember... What happened to me? I'll tell you later. What? What happened to you? I don't remember. I don't remember anything. What? Let's go out first. I came with you. Detective! Detective! Let's go. What the hell is this? What? Didn't we come down here? Let's go. What? Why are we on the same floor? Help me! I think... I'm trapped in the school. You're trapped? Why? I'm trapped in the school. Why? I'm trapped in the school. What? Madam. Madam! There's no one. Excuse me! Is anyone there? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I met him... It was a good luck. I think... you dropped this earlier. Did you give this to me on purpose? How do you feel now? What? Do you still want to die? Or... do you want to kill me? What are you talking about? The lines on your head. You know what it means, right? Don't you want to get rid of them? The red lines... The old lines... Everyone will see the world you see with your glasses. Sooner or later. Without glasses. When that time comes... Don't you want to know what people will do? It will be a weakness that cannot be hidden from someone. And other people will try to use it. So... I... I came to help you. After that... I found the meaning of my new life. I... I... I... I... I... I am now... I am trying to end my last sin. The day the world turns red... We will all... We will all be reborn! Judy... I am sorry. Please don't do this. I love you so much. I love you. Kyung Jin. There's something I didn't tell you. I've actually been seeing something weird since I was born. Is this something weird? Ha... I like it. Where did you get that? It looks like a mushroom. It's a suit. But I heard you can see the S-line without glasses when you die. Is it true? What? You said that. You? Ha... I'm sorry. Ha... Ha... What is it? Ha... What is it? Don't you want to save Seon Ah? Ha... Ah! Ha... Ha... No! Put down the knife. Put down the knife! Ha... Detective. How was the world without glasses? Wasn't it beautiful? In a little while, the whole world will turn red. Ha... Ordinary people can't kill me. You're the one who put Seon Ah on the roof? If Seon Ah wasn't in the hospital, would you have seen her properly? I gave you a chance. Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Let go! Ha... Ha... Ha... No! Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Where are we? Your cheeks... What's wrong with your eyes? Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Ha... Huff... Cloud is in someone else's hands Stop! Why did you do this? Why did you do this? Didn't you always wonder? Why you were born to see the red line. It's for today, Hyunwoo. You're not cursed. You're a gift and a blessing. Don't lie. People kill each other. Friends and family die. How can you send a slime when such things happen? People are curious. You still don't know, Hyunwoo? The S-line. Don't you feel the desire of people who want to see the S-line? I'm just a representative of that desire. The S-line Mom. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was too late. I had glasses too. Are you here? Yes. Did you eat? What's wrong? It's not your fault. Hey! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The S-line The S-line Your death will bring the blessing to humanity. The S-line The S-line The S-line The S-line It's too late. You've already proved the reason for your existence. We both did everything we could. The S-line The S-line I'm sorry. The S-line Hyunwoo. Are you okay? Let's go. The S-line The S-line Hyunwoo. Let's go see the S-line. What's this? The sky is so red. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. The S-line The S-line Someday, everyone will see the world you see. The S-line The world where everyone sees the S-line. Eventually, I became an ordinary person who wanted so much. A huge wave of the world shook the world for almost a year. People tried to figure out why the S-line was created, but they couldn't find the answer. Sunhwa eventually woke up. In a world full of S-lines, she was born again without an S-line. Sunhwa and Detective Han didn't ask each other anything. They just comforted each other that they were alive. Why did you come in? I told you not to come in. What do you want to eat? I want to go to the store with Uncle. Why? What's the matter? Look up, Uncle. Didn't you see the floor? Everyone's looking at you. And I... became alone again. The world where everyone sees the world you see. Uncle. I want to go to the store with you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Try to relax. I'm sorry. The End
