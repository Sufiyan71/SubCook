 I'm sorry. Uncle, wake up. Uncle, wake up. Uncle. What's wrong? Kang Seon-ah. There was nothing I wanted in life. All I wanted was a life that wasn't so hard. But the things I wanted to get away from came back as homework to me. Kang Seon-ah When did she... It's amazing. Hey, come here. Yes? Come here. Bend down a little. Why? What? What? When did you say you met Se-yoon? At college. Before that? Didn't you have any friends? I did. How many? One. You're a different person from me. Oh my god. Why are you wearing glasses all of a sudden? Is it because you want to see the criminal's eyes? It doesn't look good on you. I know. What's going on? Are you a student at Bangju High School? Yes. Come here. Come here. Can a criminal do this? Bring me the warrant. You're talking like a warrant. Are you arresting me? You're asking me to go to the friend's hospital. I have something to check. Who's your friend? What do you check? Come here. Wow. Wait a minute. Can I go now? Wait. Do you know that Seon-hwa is another guy's friend? A boyfriend? Can't you tell? I don't know about boyfriends. I think there are people who hate them. Oh, is that you? Don't talk to me. You know, I'm just talking like this. I'm going to kill the devil. I think you hate Kim Hye-young more than Kim Hye-young. Isn't it Hyun-woo's birthday next week? When is it? November 1st. Let's do it. I don't like it. Why? I've never done that. I'm sorry, but you don't have a choice. Before we meet together, Would you like to see me first? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How do I look? I don't like it. What are you talking about? Hey, Jin-won. Hey, don't you have practice today? Why did you go to school? No. Hey, crazy. Why are you in such a bad mood today? I don't know. Why are you laughing? I'll try it. I'm sorry. Hey. I think a minor case of a hand-cooked case has occurred. Soomin can go in. I think it would be nice if you could go in with me. Who is it? A week ago, I went to my senior's house and drank with him. I used to be friends with my brother who practiced idol together. We were drinking together. I was out of my mind for a moment. When I woke up, I was wearing my underwear upside down. What about your brother? I left a message saying I'd go out first. Do you have any experience of sexual intercourse before that? No. Why are you lying? What? No. Let's go see my senior first. Hello. I was born in high school. What are you mumbling about? I'm bored of school. I wonder when I'll be in high school. I know. There are a lot of accidents at school these days. Detective. Hello. Hello. What are you talking about? Oh, you're hiding it alone. It's nice to see you again. But it's not a good thing, is it? How's Seon-ah? She's still at the hospital. I'm thinking of going with the kids. Is it okay? Not yet. Oh, I see. But you're wearing glasses. It looks good on you. It looks good on me? Your ears are red. You know Seon-ah from class 7, right? No. I'm sorry. Seon-ah. What's your relationship with Yoon Jin-ho? I just know him. We were trainees together before. Did you drink with him at his office on September 20th? Yes. Where are your parents? They're abroad. I came to study there, but I'm living alone. Can you high school students drink like this? What's so confident about it? I'm sorry, detective. I was studying and I got stressed out. Are you here as the victim of sexual assault? Do you know? Oh. Is that what Yoon Jin-ah is? I didn't sleep with her. I don't want to sleep with her. Kids these days are scary. They look so scary. What will the investigation team come up with? I'll go. I'm going to get a face. I was going to tell you first. Give it to me. I can't give it to you because it's evidence. Can you use evidence like that? I need to test what it's for. Then you should send it to the surveillance team. That's right. But the moment I put this glasses on, Wow, that's true. I got goosebumps. I'm so glad. Now I trust you. You trust me, too. I don't trust you. Throw it away right now. Calm down. Detective. You don't know about Seon-ah? And the man in the house above. I said I found the glasses on the spot. You don't know? Every time an incident occurs, it's connected to the glasses. It's dangerous to have it. Hey, you're good at talking. That's why I have to use it more. And what's wrong with the glasses? Glasses are not dangerous. I don't know how glasses make you. What's going on? What's wrong with Hyun-woo? It's nothing. He's from my neighborhood. Our Hyun-woo is really special. Do you want to have dinner with me soon? Pardon? No, I'll call you. Hello. You're early. Sit down. Yoon-jin. I brought him here myself. But he didn't want to work hard. So I told him to quit if he didn't want to. I didn't force him to. It's not like he's a big deal. I'm sorry. He's not my type. What kind of style was he? I'm just saying this because it's my style. He wasn't that talented. If he wasn't talented, he should have tried harder. But he can't do both. He likes to play. He's a high schooler. He drinks and dates guys. Is this really going to work? We can't rule out the possibility of being a high schooler. Don't judge anything yet. I hate these kinds of cases. What kind of cases? Truth or dare. They're both minors. It's a sensitive case. It's a 100% sure lie detector. Is there anything like that? It doesn't make sense. What? Nothing. Do you like that Seonhwa? What? What are you talking about? I'm just saying. I was a bit lazy. I always get a call asking me out. I'm a senior in high school. I'm not even a trainee. Can I see your text? Yes. You deleted all my texts. You washed all my underwear and underwear. You reported me a week after the incident. Did you ever think that this would be unfavorable for you? I told you. I didn't want to believe you. You could be charged with murder. Detective. I'm Jina's brother. It's not Jina's fault. Wait a minute. I'm sorry. The Yoonjin. I'll ask you one last time. The forced sex... No. Is it true that there was a forced sex between Seonhwa and you? You don't need to send this to the prosecutor. What? Hey, sunglasses. What? Why aren't you calling me today? When did I ever call you that? Oh. A gift? It might not be a gift. I saw your case. Your parents were there. I saw all of them. The one who was there. I saw the one who was there. I saw your case. It's not your fault that your parents did that. I'm just afraid you might think that way. This is what it looked like. It's different from the face I remember. Do you want to find your mom? Seonhwa did. If she were alive, wouldn't she have come to see me? As you said, these glasses might be dangerous. But it could help someone. Like you saved the woman in room 204. So who are you looking for? Oh. You know Yoon Jinah from your class? Yes. She reported it as sexual assault. I confirmed it as a false accusation. With this. There was no S-line between them. There was no S-line. Yoon Jinah said she had no sexual experience. But she had four S-lines. She was so annoying because she was an idol. She's a teacher. What Yoon Jinah said. It could be true. A week ago. There was no S-line. Yes. Did you hand over the case already? I'm cleaning it up. Don't leave it yet. What? I'm starting over. I don't think this is right. Seunghwan. I'm a cop. Are you in there? Seunghwan. Hello, detective. Can I come in for a second? Yes, come in. Hello. Wow. The house is so clean. I have a little anorexia. Did you drink alcohol here? I sat here and ate, and I fainted. I lied on the bed. Don't you have any alcohol accidents? I don't like to keep things like that Guys I have to leave early tomorrow Can I sleep? I went back after thinking about it There was a glasses in the bathroom The reason why you had the glasses If someone intentionally delivered it? That's impossible How do you know I'm going back there? Everything doesn't make sense now I'm not going to see the S-line I'm going to see the S-line Those glasses There must be someone who brought the glasses from the S-line Who is that? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? How did you get here? I was passing by and you were in front of me I followed you because I was wondering what was going on But you disappeared from here You didn't answer my call But why did you come back here? I left something when I was working Aren't you scared? I'm a little scared I'm scared You said you saw something weird in my eyes Yes Now Your hair Don't do it If I were to have the S-line I would have to go with you I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry If I were to be with you What? I think it would be okay if I saw something weird in your eyes Why is this melting from the morning? It's okay This is okay It's done Okay, thank you How long will it take? It's fast How did you think of getting a blanket? That sheet The color of the sheet kept getting on my mind It doesn't look good on me A decent blanket Not just a trash can But a medical book It means there's something wrong But I'm not sure But It means I'm not going to go It means you learn to escape from others and your own actions Seohan Let go Why aren't you talking?

I have a concussion I have a concussion I have a concussion I have a concussion I have a concussion I think I said it five times that I can't sleep in a blanket How do you explain Yoon Jin-ah's blood?

About 5 to 10 minutes? Then someone goes into the room in the meantime Then there's an S-line That means she fainted before she drank the beer What line? Huh?
